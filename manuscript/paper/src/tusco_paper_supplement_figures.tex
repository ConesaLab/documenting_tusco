  \section{Supplementary Figures}
  This section compiles visual summaries referenced throughout the manuscript.
  Supplementary Figure S1 contrasts fundamental transcript properties between
  TUSCO controls and canonical annotations in human and mouse, while
  Supplementary Figure~S2 benchmarks expression and splicing invariance of
  TUSCO genes against other single-isoform loci. Figure~S3 links sequencing
  yield with TUSCO false negatives, Figure~S4 profiles long-read reconstruction
  pipelines under native and TUSCO-novel evaluations, and Figure~S5 examines
  per-read coverage distributions supporting TUSCO transcripts. Finally,
  Figure~S6 evaluates how SIRV-based concordance metrics respond to replicate
  number, contextualising the stability of spike-in controls relative to
  endogenous benchmarks.

      \caption{\textbf{TUSCO genes are highly expressed and display minimal novel splicing signal.} Violin--box plots compare AlphaGenome-predicted scores for TUSCO genes with single-isoform genes annotated in both GENCODE and RefSeq for human and mouse. The top row shows the Expression score (gene-level tissue-median RPKM); the bottom row shows the Splicing score (for each gene, the maximum AlphaGenome-predicted unannotated-to-annotated splice-junction count ratio across tissues). Values are plotted as $\log_{10}$ (score $+ 1 \times 10^{-4}$). Across both species, TUSCO genes exhibit substantially higher expression and lower novel splicing score ratios than other single-isoform genes, consistent with their selection as widely expressed, splicing-invariant controls. Box centers mark medians; boxes span the interquartile range; whiskers extend $1.5 \times$ IQR. Colors: Human TUSCO (light green), Mouse TUSCO (darker green), Human Other (light gray), Mouse Other (dark gray).}

      \caption{\textbf{False negatives decrease with effective sequencing yield.} Scatter plot showing the percentage of recomputed TUSCO false negatives (y-axis) versus a composite metric, $\log(\text{Total Reads}) \times \text{Median Read Length}$ (x-axis), across LRGASP datasets. Point shape encodes method (triangle: ONT-cDNA; diamond: ONT-dRNA; circle: PacBio-cDNA), color indicates cell line (ES, WTC11), and point size denotes short-read support (larger = yes). Labels include dataset names; ``-LS'' marks libraries with length selection. A linear fit with 95\% confidence band (gray) reveals a strong negative correlation (Pearson $r$ and $p$ shown on plot), indicating that higher effective depth and longer reads substantially reduce false negatives, consistent with technical rather than biological causes. Total TUSCO genes: human $n=57$; mouse $n=30$.}

      \caption{\textbf{Performance of long-read transcriptome reconstruction pipelines on the TUSCO benchmark for discovering unannotated genes.} Panels \textbf{a--h} (\textbf{a}, Bambu-Novel; \textbf{b}, Bambu-Reference; \textbf{c}, StringTie-Novel; \textbf{d}, StringTie-Reference; \textbf{e}, FLAIR-Novel; \textbf{f}, FLAIR-Reference; \textbf{g}, Iso-Seq-Novel; \textbf{h}, Iso-Seq-Reference) show stacked-bar summaries for each human (WTC11-*) and mouse (ES-*) sample: total bar height equals the number of multi-exon TUSCO genes assessed, colors indicate reconstruction outcomes (complete, truncation, false positive, false negative), and hatched areas denote genes lacking short-read support. Percentages inside bars refer to complete (green) calls. Panels \textbf{i--p} summarize concordance metrics (non-redundant sensitivity, non-redundant precision, inverse redundancy, 1-FDR, positive detection rate, F1 score) using radar plots comparing human and mouse performance for each pipeline.}

      \caption{\textbf{Per-read coverage of TUSCO transcripts in LRGASP Iso-Seq cDNA data.} Violin-plus-box plots show the distribution of per-read coverage $f = L_{\text{read}}/L_{\text{exonic}}$ for TUSCO-mapped reads, separated by species (human WTC11, mouse ES). Reads are labeled by SQANTI as TP (full-splice match; reference\_match) or PTP (incomplete/partial splice match). Only multi-exon TUSCO transcripts are included; reference- and novel-evaluation classifications are combined; no TSS-based filtering; outliers retained; y-axis 0--2.0. Human: TP 84.3\% (median 98.3\%, $n=4,892$); PTP 54.7\% (median 31.7\%, $n=633$). Mouse: TP 79.7\% (median 94.7\%, $n=8,920$); PTP 62.1\% (median 53.7\%, $n=2,564$).}

      \caption{\textbf{SIRV spike-in controls exhibit minimal dependence on replicate number.} Concordance metrics (sensitivity, non-redundant precision, inverse redundancy, 1-FDR, PDR, F1) were computed on FLAIR-identified SIRV transcripts from PacBio Sequel IIe cDNA libraries ($\sim$5 M reads per library). Metrics were summarized across all replicate combinations for 1--5 biological replicates (bars: mean with 95\% CI; points: individual combinations). Performance was essentially invariant with replicate number: precision, inverse redundancy and 1-FDR were $\sim$100\% at all levels; brain sensitivity was 86.1\% (83.7--88.5) at 1 replicate and $\sim$85.5\% at 3--5; kidney sensitivity ranged 80.3\% (78.4--82.1; 2 replicates) to 87.0\% (5 replicates). F1 remained stable (brain $\sim$92.2\%; kidney $\sim$89.0--93.0\%). These results indicate that SIRV spike-ins yield highly consistent concordance irrespective of replicate count.}
